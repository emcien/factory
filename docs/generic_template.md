# Generic Factory Template

A factory is a collection of [jobs](jobs.md) that are configured to work
together to take some input(s) from the customer's systems, prepare and run
them through Emcien or other systems to process them in some manner and then
outputs the results back into the customer's systems or other factories for
downstream processing.
